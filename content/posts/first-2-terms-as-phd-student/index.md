I started my life as a PhD student late in September last year and I'm proud to say that I've altogether enjoyed my experience so far! While difficult at first, I think I've finally just about gotten used to academic culture - *read lots, write lots, explain everything and critique even more.*

I've had several busy months, during which I've learnt about the ins and outs of Natural Language Processing - including old methods that use Hidden Markov Models and Deep Neural Networks, and new ones that use Recurrent Neural Networks in Sequence to Sequence models[^1]. I've also built a web app called [Stammered Voice] to support my project by collecting voice samples from people with stammers. I'm fortunate enough to have access to a shared office so I get to work alongside other PhD students who are also doing very interesting things.

On a less technical note, however, I've also come to learn a few other things about being a PhD student that I didn't know before starting. So, without further ado, let's go through them:

## 1. You're a Student, But Also Not Really

I was fortunate enough to start my PhD a few months after I had graduated from my Bachelor's CompSci degree. Doing so, I expected my life as a PhD student to start the way my other university years had started - with a week to settle in before the real work began. So, imagine my surprise when I stroll into my supervisor's office midweek and ask him when I start, only to find out that I was meant to start a couple days before. :neutral_face:

As Mr Darcy says in *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen:

> I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.[^2]

That was my first taste of the difference between Undergraduate life and PhD life. Before I knew it, I was helping out in labs that my supervisor ran, writing assignments for the students, and marking them too. These all felt like lecturer-y things to do.

At the same time, I was studying...

[^1]: Don't worry if you didn't understand some of these terms - in time, I may write a few posts about these concepts but they're not important right now!
[^2]: Sure, it was for a very different reason but it's definitely still apt.
