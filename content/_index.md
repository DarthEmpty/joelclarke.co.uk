I am a Computer Science graduate with experience in both leadership and AI/ML research.

I spent an extended period of time working on a PhD at **[Royal Holloway University](rhul.ac.uk)**, focussed on improving Voice Assistants to handle stammered speech using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

I also help lead **[The Journey Church](thejourney.org.uk)** as part of a voluntary team, where I am responsible for our finances, the content of our website, and maintaining relationships with other churches and Christian initiatives.

I relax by drawing in my spare time! I am inspired by the professional and amateur art that I've seen over the years and am very keen to improve my own skills. Check out the **[Gallery](/gallery/)** if you're at all interested in what I've been up to!
